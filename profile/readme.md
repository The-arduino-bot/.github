# hello there!

(Verse 1)
I'm the king of the chicken wing,
Got the sauce dripping, hear me sing.
Devious rhymes, got my flow,
Spitting hot fire, watch me go.

(Chorus)
Chicken wings and Linux kernel,
That's my game, ain't no hurdle.
Working hard, code to debug,
Fueling up, with wings to chug.

(Verse 2)
Linux command line, that's my style,
Writing code, mile by mile.
Eating wings, with my crew,
Solving problems, what we do.

(Chorus)
Chicken wings and Linux kernel,
That's my game, ain't no hurdle.
Working hard, code to debug,
Fueling up, with wings to chug.

(Bridge)
Open source, that's the way,
Collaboration every day.
Sharing knowledge, breaking walls,
Chicken wings, fueling all.

(Verse 3)
Got my keyboard, and my plate,
No time to waste, gotta innovate.
Writing code, with my hands,
Chewing wings, like a man.

(Chorus)
Chicken wings and Linux kernel,
That's my game, ain't no hurdle.
Working hard, code to debug,
Fueling up, with wings to chug.
